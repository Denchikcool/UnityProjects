Projects for my soul 
Greetings to everyone who miraculously got into my repository! 
I am a young and ambitious game developer who wants to start his journey in this direction.
Here I will publish my work, which I do during the course of my studies. 
Yes, they won't be perfect, they won't be complicated, but I'm just gaining experience. 
I hope that people from the field of game development will be interested in me and I will finally be able to fulfill my childhood dream!
